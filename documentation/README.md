# Let Us C - Project 1

Welcome! This is where the project is hosted, along with all the necessary libraries to hopefully run the project.

## Platforms Supported:

- Linux (Platforms Tested: Arch)
- Windows

## How to Build

There are a couple of ways you can get the program to build. Some are easier than others.

### QtCreator

Qt Creator can handle the build process for you if you have a full installation of Qt and Qt creator.

This is by far the easiest method to get the project built, but it is not the only way.

### Qmake (With a Full Qt and Qmake Installation)

If you would rather hand make the project than use an IDE, what you need to run is this:

```
qmake -o Makefile EECS448Project1.pro
make

```

This should build the project in the same directory, and allow you to run the program.

## Running the Program

Libraries as in accordance with the LGPL 2.1 have been left in the project so that you may
 do with them as you wish. If you have not built the program, but have by some means managed
 to get a binary or executable, you should be able to run the program, so long as your system tools
 are up to date with the versions used to compile that executable.
 
 
## Where to get Qt?

While the libraries for merely running the application are provided,
 to build it, and to utilize all the features of Qt, a link can be found
 [here](https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/?hsCtaTracking=f977210e-de67-475f-a32b-65cec207fd03%7Cd62710cd-e1db-46aa-8d4d-2f1c1ffdacea)
 and on the Works Cited file located in the documentation folder.
