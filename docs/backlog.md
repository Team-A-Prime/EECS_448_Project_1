 - Copying times from one day to the others
   - Complexity: **low**. This will require adding a button with the required logic behind it.
   - Time requirement: **low**.
 - Task list
   - Complexity: **medium**. This won't require modifying a lot of existing code, rather just adding new code.
   - Time requirement: **high**. The new code will have to be tested/debugged more than the rest, as it is a completely new feature. The likelihood of introducing new bugs is high.
 - Event creator view
   - Complexity: **low**. This will be handled mostly by implementing the task list itself.
   - Time requirement: **low**.
